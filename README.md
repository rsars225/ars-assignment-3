# ars-assignment-3
Third assignment of the class. Done with AI generated images.
The purpose of the assignment was to first create something from my dataset which looked very bright and happy. After inspiration from my peers and classmates i decided to take it in a bit of a different direction. Rather than focusing on cute somewhat unrealistic photos of nature that had a positive vibe. I took the path of displaying human consequences on nature. Since we worked with text as well, I thought it would be interesitng to work with a well known children's tale/poem, known as The Giving Tree. My art depicts the end consequences of what happens when nature not only gives, but humans jsut take and take. The two images were the result of two different prompts, so the fact that the tree style and background aligns so well was a surprise to me.
